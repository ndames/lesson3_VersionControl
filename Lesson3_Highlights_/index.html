            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three types of version control systems. Local version control systems were one of the first forms of VCS. They were more based on when one user needed to keep track of their work. A local VCS would keep track of changes through the use of basic databases. The second type of version control system is a centralized version control system. Centralized VCS was the predominant choice when people wanted to use version control. The major downfall to this type of system was that due it being centralized it created one point of failure. The last type of version control is the distributed version control system. In this system users will receive copies of the repository to edit instead of the master version of the data.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git Hub, a distributed version control system has three different ways of maintaining a file. Files can be committed, modified ,or staged. If a file is edited or added it is considered modified because there are new changes made to it. After modification the user could make a file marked for staging which means that it would be included in the next commit of files. The last state of a file is when it is committed. This state means that a file has been stored in the local database and will be there in the the snapshot of the version. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two ways to commence a repository in Git Hub. A user can either initialize a repository in a directory that has already been created, or the user can make a copy of a repository that has been made previously. When beginning a new repository in an existing directory the user would need to create a new subdirectory that has the important repository files. After creating the subdirectory the user should ensure that the new repository has its files tracked and has been committed. When making a copy of an existing repository you use the $git clone command. This makes a complete clone of the existing repository as well as the majority of the data included in the original. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Ignoring a file in Git Hub can be very beneficial to users for various reasons. For instance if there is a file that that you are not yet ready to stage but you also dont want the file to show up during status commands. There are many ways to ignore different types of files in Git Hub. The main command for this is $ cat .gitignore after this command you can add specifications for which types of files you wish to ignore. A "*.[oa]" will ignore all files that end with an o or a. FIles ending in these two letters are generally object or archive files. Another thing that is ignored are lines that begin with a pound symbol.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Benefits of Using Version Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control systems have made it far simpler for people to keep track of different editions of coding or programming projects. A main benefit of them is that files are never completely replaced. Any changes that are made are saved as a new copy istead of overwriting the last version of the file. Although there may be a common repository files are distributed in a way that makes it nearly impossible for them to be lost because the system forces files to be backed up consistently. Due to this system it is very accessible for users to revert back to a previous snapshot of the files for any reason. Since users get their own copies of master files this allows for collaboration to occur without the need to worry if the same file is being manipulated at once.  </p>
